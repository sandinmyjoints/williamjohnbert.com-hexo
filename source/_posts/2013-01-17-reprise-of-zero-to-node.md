At [NodeDC's January meetup](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/98796672/),
I'll be giving a reprise of my
[Zero to Node](http://sandinmyjoints.github.com/zero-to-node/) talk, about
designing, coding, and launching my first web service using Node.js. The meetup
is Wednesday, Jan 23, at Stetson's (1610 U St NW). Hope to see you there!
