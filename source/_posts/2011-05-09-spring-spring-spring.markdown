[![](http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jbb_cr2.jpg)](http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jbb_cr2.jpg)Spring is the rarest of seasons in DC, but it looks like we get a few days of it this week. This could not be happening at a better time. The protracted move from Columbia Heights/Baltimore/Tucson to Capitol Hill is over. The [art show](http://www.callandresponsedc.org/) has wrapped. Work is still way busy, but next week I head to North Carolina for some writing time in the mountains at [Doe Branch Ink](http://doebranchink.org/)--the ideal vacation.

Craig Nova is the resident author for this session at DBI, and I'm looking forward to reading his novel _The Good Son_, starting on the commute home this afternoon. It'll be good to dive back into reading and writing, which have taken a back seat so far this season. I did have the honor of getting tapped for [a Larry Neal award](http://dcarts.dc.gov/DC/DCARTS/Events/Annual+Programming/Annual+Programming#4), 2nd place for adult fictionÂ  (the non-euphemistic kind), for a story I began back in Arizona but kept revisiting up until last fall. That just made me want to sit down and get back to writing, drafting, and revising even more! I don't have any illusions that late spring and summer will be slow, but few things suck up time more than moving, and with a good solid week to get jump-started, I'm feeling optimistic.
