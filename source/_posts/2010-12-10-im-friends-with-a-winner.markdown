Congrats to my friend Mark Polanzak, who [won the 2010  Pint and Pen Contest](http://digboston.com/laugh/2010/11/bukowski-pint-and-pen-contest-winners/). The contest rules:


> **Type up** (and print out if you must) a story that includes the words **PINT**, **PEN**, **BUKOWSKI **and **HARPOON**. Entries must be typed, in reverence to the brilliant Charles Bukowski. The word count must be between 500 and 750 words.


Read Mark's kick-ass story [here](http://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pint%20and%20Pen%20Winner%20-%20Mark%20Polanzak.pdf). On a personal note, Bukowski is one of those famous authors who I've somehow never read.
