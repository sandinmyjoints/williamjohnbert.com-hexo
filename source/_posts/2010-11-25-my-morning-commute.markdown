Fellow 826DC volunteer and all-around awesome person [Anna started a Tumblr](http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/) to collect photos of people's morning commutes. I thought that was a great way to turn what can be one of a day's most unremarkable stretches into something seen anew, so I contributed a [couple](http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/post/1620568222/william-29-washington-dc-sunrise-comes-to) [photos](http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/post/1648509699/william-29-washington-d-c-museum-of-unnatural) and plan to send more. At the moment (Happy Thanksgiving!) several of the commute photos involve seriously beautiful skyscapes.
