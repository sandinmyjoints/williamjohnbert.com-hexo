In December, I gave a talk at
[Nova Node](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/events/154016332/) called
["Towards 100% Uptime with Node.js"](http://sandinmyjoints.github.io/towards-100-pct-uptime/).
I wrote an accompanying blog post for the
[Fluencia / SpanishDict engineering blog](http://engineering.fluencia.com):
[The 4 Keys to 100% Uptime with Node.js](http://engineering.spanishdict.com/blog/2013/12/20/the-4-keys-to-100-uptime-with-nodejs).

Hopefully these resources will be useful for other Node engineers out
there&mdash;they have helped us have confidence that downtime is not a problem
for our users.
