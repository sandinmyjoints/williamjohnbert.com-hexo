I'm giving a talk about my experience [developing and deploying a Node.js web
service in production](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/events/84918342/) at the
next Nova-Node meetup, October 30 at 6:30 p.m. Below is the writeup. If it
sounds interesting to you, come by!

> SpanishDict recently deployed a new text-to-speech service powered by
  Node. This service can generate audio files on the fly for arbitrary Spanish
  and English texts with rapid response times. The presentation will walk
  through the design, development, testing, monitoring, and deployment process
  for the new application. We will cover topics like how to structure an Express
  app, testing and debugging, learning to think in streams and pipes, writing a
  Chef cookbook to deploy to AWS, and monitoring the application for high
  performance. The lead engineer on the project, William Bert, will also talk
  about his experiences transitioning from a Python background to Node and some
  of the key insights he had about writing in Node while developing the
  application.

Update: [here are the slides from the talk](http://sandinmyjoints.github.com/zero-to-node).
