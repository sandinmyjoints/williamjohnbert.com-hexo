[![Plane flying in clouds](http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_0746.jpg)](http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_0746.jpg)If I updated more regularly, I would have written entire posts about the following things.



	
  * AWP 2011 came and went blazingly fast. I saw many people I've missed dearly, and missed many people I would've liked to see.

	
  * The second workshop with the Bell Poetry Club for [826DC](http://www.826dc.org/), this time diving into the poem-as-extended-metaphor, went swimmingly.

	
  * A story of mine is going to be published in the first issue of Anomalous.

	
  * And I continue working on my reading series Django app. Possible names: Readsr, or Readzee, or Readoo, or maybe Readthing. Hmm. Are any of these, like, any good? Tonight's task: refactoring and adding messaging.
