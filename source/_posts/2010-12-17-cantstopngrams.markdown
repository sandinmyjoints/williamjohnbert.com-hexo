[![A laptop on a desk](../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_11401.jpg)](../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_11401.jpg)Google's new toy, [ngrams](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com), graphs the relative frequency of words and phrases occurring in books published over an arbitrary time period from 1500 to 2008. Let's go. (All search the English Fiction corpus from 1908 to 2008 except the last, which searches American English, 1858-2008.)
