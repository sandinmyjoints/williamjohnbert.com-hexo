A few days ago, I happened by chance to read these two articles one after the other:

* [I like Unicorn because it's Unix](http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix)

* [The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel Is The Problem, Not The Solution](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/5/13/the-secret-to-10-million-concurrent-connections-the-kernel-i.html)

The first is about how good Unix is at scaling the scheduling and distribution
of work among processes. The second is about how Unix is the problem when it
comes to the scheduling and distribution of work at scale.

The question, of course, is "What scale?". Like the difference between a cure and a
poison is sometimes the dosage.
