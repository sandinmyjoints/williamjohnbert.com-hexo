An interlude from the recent trend of hardcore Django action:

> When I spoke with a female intern this summer, she recounted how, in 2006, the 
> GNOME Project, a free and open source software project, received almost 200 Google 
> Summer of Code applicants. All of them were male. When GNOME advertised an 
> identical program for women, emphasizing opportunities for learning and mentorship 
> instead of tough competition, they received more than 100 highly qualified female 
> applicants for the three spots they were able to fund. What amazed me even more was 
> when she suggested that our own company slogan — “We Help the World’s Best 
> Developers Make Better Software” — might alienate prospective female candidates. 
> That had never occurred to me. But according to our intern, in the world of 
> computer science, “when you hear the phrase ‘the world’s best developers,’ you see 
> a guy.”
