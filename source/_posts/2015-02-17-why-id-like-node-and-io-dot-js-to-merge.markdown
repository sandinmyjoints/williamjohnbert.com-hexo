I made [nodegovernance.io](http://nodegovernance.io/) &mdash; which encourages Node
users to express support for using io.js's open governance model as the basis
for the Node foundation's technical committee &mdash; because from where I sit,
one Node with a technical committee composed of the best technical people is the
ideal outcome of this situation.

My life would be easier if there were just one Node. My team wouldn't have to
spend time discussing and deciding which to use. There wouldn't be any confusion
in the future about whether `npm install` would give me a module I could use
with whatever runtime I happened to be using.

The
[recent Medium post](https://medium.com/@iojs/io-js-and-a-node-js-foundation-4e14699fb7be)
said that io.js met with Joyent CEO Scott Hammond last week, so I'm sure he
knows exactly where they stand.

And the big companies that are already on the foundation board are certainly
going to get input into the rules for the technical committtee.

What about the rest of us &mdash; engineers who use Node / io.js every day but
aren't inner core, who don't work for an IBM or a PayPal, who want stability and
also language improvements that will make our jobs easier?

I hated the idea of looking back a few months from now, in the midst of heated
discussions about whether to use Node or io.js, with <span style="white-space:nowrap;">`npm install`s</span> failing all around me, and wondering if there was
anything I could have done to prevent this situation. A tweet doesn't count for
all that much, but it's more than nothing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/williamjohnbert">@williamjohnbert</a> Thanks William. The TC will consider that when they define the governance model.</p>&mdash; Scott Hammond (@Scott_Hammond) <a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Hammond/status/566045931657633792">February 13, 2015</a></blockquote>
