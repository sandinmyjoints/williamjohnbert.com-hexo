Friday, I helped out with an 826DC workshop at Bell Multicultural High School in Columbia Heights. Bell's Poetry Club meets after school each Friday, and we came by  to work with them on metaphor. To fuel the discussion, we read "Snow Leopards at the Denver Zoo" by [William Matthews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Matthews_%28poet%29) (who I'd never heard of before—I'm so not a poet):

>     and keep her all the days of my life,

A few metaphors there, huh? It's a swift poem, turning from accessible to knotty in the space of a few lines. Great for discussion, and the students were more than up to the task. The writing exercise we did next further showed off their chops. We all took 20 minutes to write a poem full of metaphors, then shared them with the group. Their stuff leapt off the page, lyrical, narrative, associative, wild and subtle and everything between.





All of us from 826DC  were seriously impressed, and I look forward to hanging out with the Bell Poetry Club again in a couple weeks. It's on us to come up with something new to challenge these talents—my prediction is we're going to learn just as much as they do.
