By day, I’m a Software Engineer for [Fluencia](http://www.fluencia.com) / [SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com).

I divide the rest of my time between working on [web development projects](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints) (and asking/answering questions on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/599258/sandinymyjoints)); hiking, traveling, and enjoying the company of my wife, Kara; [writing](http://williamjohnbert.com/publications/) (mostly fiction); and working on other projects such as volunteering with [826DC](http://826dc.org/) and co-curating [Call + Response](http://www.callandresponsedc.org).
