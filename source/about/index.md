By day, I get to work with incredibly smart, talented, and all-around great
people at [Curiosity Media](http://www.curiositymedia.com), where I'm a Senior
Software Engineer and the team lead for
[SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com), the world's largest
Spanish-English language learning and reference website. I also led the effort
to prototype and bring our newest product, [PubNation](http://pubnation.com), an
ad quality plaform, to life.

I divide the rest of my time between working on my own
[projects, both software and otherwise](http://williambert.online/projects);
hiking and backpacking, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountains; and
thoroughly enjoying the company of my wife, Kara. I also write -- both
[blog posts](http://williambert.online) and
[fiction and essays](http://williamjohnbert.com/publications/) now and then.
